'OnlyTAQ.py' is designed to go through all the label files within the
folder where the Python script is located. It will return a file by the
name of 'OnlyTAQs.csv'. This csv will contain all the TAQs without having
the overlap repetition. TO RUN THE SCRIPT OPEN THE PYTHON FILE IN IDLE AND
TYPE 'main()' INTO THE SHELL AND PRESS ENTER. Every time the program runs
it will overwrite the previous 'OnlyTAQs.csv'. The csv file will be 
unordered due to the properties of python dictionaries. You may easily sort
the csv by selecting all the cells under the column 'File Name' and select
'Sort & Filter' in the EXCEL ribbon menu. If prompted, select expand
selection to ensure the rows a preserved.
